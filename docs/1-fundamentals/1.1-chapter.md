# 1. Fundamentals

## 1.1 The Documents Blockchain

Commercio.network is an [OPEN SOURCE PROJECT](https://github.com/commercionetwork) that gives companies the ability to sign and exchange documents using the blockchain technology and guarantee:

* ***Paternity*** the document was created by the declared sender
* ***Non-repudiation*** the sender cannot deny having sent the document
* ***Integrity*** the document has not been altered during transport


There are two main groups of business documents:

* **Structured**: Mostly XMl (Invoices, orders, order confirmations etc)
* **Unstructured**: Mostly PDF (Contracts, forms, letters etc)

The network is organized through an [international consortium](https://www.commercioconsortium.org) of 100 independent companies.  Any company, especially yours, is welcome to join the consortium and take advantage of the next decade technology... Today.

The Commercio.network is called _The Documents Blockchainâ„¢_ because it focuses on solving one core business problem : **Legally Exchanging and signing business documents.**
