## 1.1 What is a blokchain?

A blockchain is a network of nodes that use a technology that allows the secure transfer of value and data between parties without the need of a trusted third party intermediary using a shared ledger.

From a technical perspective, blockchain is a combination of three existing technologies that put together creates a network able to  secure trust between people or parties who do not trust each another:

*Software* a write-only database to store information  which is agreed through a pre-defined consensus protocol, and a peer2peer networking layer to exchange information.

*Strong Cryptography* to sign and verify all process and trasactions among the network partecipants

*Cryptoeconomics* to provide the economic incentives (Carrot) to run the network in a non altruistic matter and provide the dis-incentives (Stick) to behave in a way that cost less to be honest than to be dishonest.

It has the potential to be the next decade technology and have huge transformational impact on the functioning of a wide range of industries. This technology can increase the transparency and traceability of goods, data and digital assets, facilitate  access and improve the efficiency of transactions.

The blockchain technology can potentialy disrupt any market where intermediaries have strong power, collect high fees, slow economic activity and are selfish keepers of personal information.
