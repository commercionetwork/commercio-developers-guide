## 1.1 What is a blockchain?

Simply put, a blockchain is a network of nodes that use a technology that allows the secure transfer of value and data (using a shared ledger) between parties without the need of a trusted third party intermediary.

From a technical perspective, blockchain is a combination of three existing technologies that are able to secure trust between people or parties who do not trust each another:

The three technologies are:

*Software* a write-only database to store information which is agreed through a pre-defined consensus protocol, and a peer2peer networking layer to exchange information.

*Strong Cryptography* to sign and verify all process and trasactions among the network partecipants

*Cryptoeconomics* to provide the economic incentives (Carrot ü•ï) to run the network in a non altruistic matter and provide the dis-incentives (Stick üèë) to behave in a way that cost less to be honest than to be dishonest.

Blockchain  has the potential to be the next decade technology and have huge transformational impact on the functioning of a wide range of business processes. This technology can increase the transparency and traceability of goods, data and digital assets, facilitate access and improve the efficiency of transactions.

The blockchain technology can potentialy disrupt any market where intermediaries have strong power, collect high fees, slow economic activity and are selfish keepers of personal information.
