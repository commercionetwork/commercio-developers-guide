## 1.3 Full node Vs Validator Node


The Commercio.network blockchain has two different nodes types: full nodes and validator nodes.


### Full nodes
Full nodes are nodes that simply store the whole transactions history. They connect to the blockchain and each time a new block is finalized, they write it on the hard disk. This means that being a full node you will be able to read the whole chain transaction history, but you will need to have a large hard disk space if you want to keep it running for a long period of time.


### Validator nodes
Validator nodes are just  full nodes with the added ability of validating new transactions that should be added to the chain. In order to do so, they possess a private key with which they sign the transactions marking them as valid. In exchange of their work, they get back a reward that is given to them each time a new block is created.
Without validator nodes, the whole chain couldn't exist and if your company decides to becoming a validator and earn transactions fees, you will also contribute to decentralize the whole Commercio.network ecosystem.
