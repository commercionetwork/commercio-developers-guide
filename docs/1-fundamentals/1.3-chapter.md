## 1.3 Full node Vs Validator Node


The Commercio.network blockchain has two different nodes types: full nodes and validator nodes.


### Full node
Full nodes are nodes that stores the whole transaction history. They connect to the blockchain and each time a new block is finalized, they write it on the hard disk. This means that being a full node you will be able to read the whole chain transaction history, you will need to have a large hard disk space if you want to keep it running.


### Validator node
Validator nodes are just full nodes with the added ability of validating new transactions that should be added to the chain. In order to do so, they possess a private key with which they sign the transactions marking them as valid. In exchange of their work, they get back a reward that is given to them each time a new block is created.
Without validator nodes, the whole chain couldn't exist and if your company decides to becoming a validator and earn transactions fees, you will also contribute to decentralize the whole Commercio.network ecosystem.

### Why is essential to install a node?

Every extra node we add to our network increase:
* Immulability value, more partecipants have a copy of the ledger
* Decentralization value, more stakeholders join the conversation.
* Distributed value, more geographycally located server, less failure risk 

For this reason we encourage anyone to download the server software and run it on premise or on their favourite cloud service. 

### How easy is to run a server?

Very, very easy. Please follow the step by step instructions to intall a Full Node
