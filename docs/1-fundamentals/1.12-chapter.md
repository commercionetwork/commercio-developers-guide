### The Test-Net

Testnet, as the name suggests, is an alternative network for the developers for testing purposes. You can view a testnet as a demo network for experimenting. It’s kind of like the beta stage of a blockchain network.

A testnet is a blockchain made available for developers. It allows developers to conduct experiments without wasting real currency.

A testnet is like a demo network where cryptocurrenciesdo not have any value on the mainnet and vice-versa. Like Monopoly game money.

You can easily test out your app on a testnet because it provides you a sandbox environment separate from the main blockchain.  You don’t need to worry about breaking things, actully it is well regarded to try to break it, since it improves overall stabilty without disruping things.

Joining a testnet allows you to run and control your own node.
Testnets are alternative blockchains for development purposes. You will be able to get Play money coins you need on your testnet through a faucet. 

Since testnets are separate blockchains, the best practice is that wallet addresses should be different from mainnet ones. 

### The Main-net

Mainnet is the complete opposite of the testnet. Mainnet is the main blockchain of Commercio.network. If someone says Commercio mainnet, it means the real Commercio blockchain.

Unlike testnet which is an open network for testing purposes, mainnet is the real deal. For Commercio and all the other cryptocurrencies, Tokens on the mainnet have real economic value.
