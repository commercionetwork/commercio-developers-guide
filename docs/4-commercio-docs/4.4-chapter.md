final sentDocs = await Network.queryChain(sentDocsURL);

final receivedDocsURL = '${wallet.networkInfo.lcdUrl}/docs/${wallet.bech32Address}/received';

final receivedDocs = await Network.queryChain(receivedDocsURL);
```

### _Kotlin_

```kotlin
val wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic = mnemonic, networkInfo = networkInfo)

val sentDocsURL = "${wallet.networkInfo.lcdUrl}/docs/${wallet.bech32Address}/sent"

val sentDocs = Network.queryChain<List<Objects>>(url = sentDocsURL)

val receivedDocsURL = "${wallet.networkInfo.lcdUrl}/docs/${wallet.bech32Address}/received"

val receivedDocs = Network.queryChain<List<Objects>>(url = receivedDocsURL)
```

### _C#_
