# 7.4 Invite a Member

Now that you have purchased a bronze membership you can invite a previously unlisted address provided by direct person to person exchange to the network.

As a Bronze member there is a reward value given to you, if someone you invite buys upgrades to a metal membership.
The reward is based on your metal membership type and the membership that any user you have accredited buys.

| Invitee / Invited | Bronze | Silver | Gold  | Black  |
|-------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Bronze            | 1.25   | 25     | 375   | 5'000  |
  
If an address has already been used in the netwok the invitation action is invalid.  
  
You need to obtain this address by direct exchange from the invitee.
  
Here's how to perform the invitaion.

## Use cases

Sends a new transaction in order to invite the given _userDid_.

## Tools

The Bitcoin _BIP39_ Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.

The _Sacco_ library, our own open source tool to sign and send transactions to any Cosmos SDK based blockchain, including Commercio.network.

The _Commercio SDK_, our own open source tool to format transactions to Commercio.network

## Functions and APIs

- Wallet _derive_;
- MembershipHelper _inviteUser_.

## Step by step sequence

1. Generate a new mnemonic using bip39;
2. Set up the network;
3. Call the wallet _derive_ function;
4. Finally, execute the MembershipHelper _inviteUser_ to invite a member.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of the implemetation in all the available languages.

### Dart

```dart
final newUserMnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic(strength: 256).split(' ');
final networkInfo = NetworkInfo(
  bech32Hrp: 'did:com:',
  lcdUrl: 'http://localhost:1317',
);
final newUserWallet = Wallet.derive(newUserMnemonic, networkInfo);

final response = await MembershipHelper.inviteUser(
  newUserWallet.bech32Address,
  wallet
);
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val networkInfo = NetworkInfo(
  bech32Hrp = "did:com:",
  lcdUrl = "http://localhost:1317"
)

val newUserMnemonic = generateMnemonic(strength = 256, wordList = WORDLIST_ENGLISH).split(" ")

val newUserWallet = Wallet.derive(newUserMnemonic, networkInfo)

val fee = StdFee(gas = "200000", amount = listOf(StdCoin(denom = "ucommercio", amount = "10000")))// optional
val mode = TxHelper.BroadcastingMode.BLOCK // optional

val response = MembershipHelper.inviteUser(
  user = Did(newUserWallet.bech32Address),
  wallet = wallet,
  fee = fee, // optional
  mode = mode // optional
)
```
