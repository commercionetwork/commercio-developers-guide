## 3.1 DID, DDO and VC Primer

The Self Sovreign Identity will probably be a basic human and machine right in the future. 

From the sovrin.org FAQ

It is a principle that states that an individual (or a acompany or a Car) should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities. Self Sovreign Idenity allows anyone to interact with each other in the digital world in the same way, with the same freedom and trust as they do in the real world.

Everyone has different relationships or unique sets of identifying information. This information could be things like date of birth, citizenship, university degrees or business licenses. In the physical world, this is represented in the form of cards and certificates that are kept by the identity holder in the wallet or in a safe place such as a safe-deposit box and is presented when the person needs to prove his or her identity or something about his or her identity.

Self-identity (SSI) brings the same freedoms and personal autonomy on the Internet into a secure and reliable identity management system. SSI means that the individual (or organization) manages the elements that make up his or her identity and controls access to those credentials digitally. In the case of SSI, the power to control personal data lies with the individual and not with an administrative third party granting or tracing access to these credentials.

The SSI identity system gives you the ability to use your digital wallet and authenticate your identity using the credentials issued to you. You no longer have to surrender control of your personal information to dozens of databases every time you want to access new goods and services, with the risk that your identity will be stolen by hackers.

This is called a "self-sovereign" identity because each person is now in control of his or her own identity: it is his or her own sovereign nation. People can control their own information and relationships. A person's digital existence is now independent of any organization: no one can take away their identity.
