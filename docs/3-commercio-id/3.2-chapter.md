# 3.2 Pairwise Did Primer

## Tools

We will use the _Commercio SDK_, our own open source tool to format transactions to Commercio.network and the _Sacco_ library, our own open source tool to sign and send transactions to any Cosmos SDK based blockchain, including Commercio.network.

## Functions and APIs

We will describe the system designed for the creation of pairwise identity.

This required the functions described in the following chapters. In particular, the most relevant methods are:

- [Chapter 3.3](3.3-chapter.md), IdHelper _setDidDocument_;
- [Chapter 3.4](3.4-chapter.md), IdHelper _requestDidPowerUp_.

## Step by step sequence

### **1 - DDO Creation**

First you need to create a `I DDO` associated with to `I DID` ([Chapter 3.3](3.3-chapter.md)).

### **2 - Send tokens to the Tumbler**

The second step is to send the tokens ([Chapter 2.9](2.9-chapter.md)) to the public address of the centralized entity `T`.

### **3 - Power Up Request**

Only after you send the tokens to `T`, finally you can create a Did power up request ([Chapter 3.4](3.4-chapter.md)).

#### **3.1 - Step by step**

**-** `I` will create a JSON (`signature_json`) containing the following information:

    ```json
    {
      "sender_did": "<User did>",
      "pairwise_did": "<Pairwise Did address to power up>",
      "timestamp": "<Timestamp>"
    }
    ```

**-** `I` retrive the Did of `T` using public endpoint `/government/tumbler` or by command `cncli query government tumbler-address`.

**-** `I` retrive the public key of `T` resolving its DDO.

**-** `I` calculate SHA-256 `hash` of `sender_did`, `pairwise_did` and `timestamp` concatenation.

**-** `I` get `sign(hash)` signing in format PKCS1v15 the `hash` with the RSA private key associated to RSA public key inserted in the DDO.

**-** `I` convert `sign(hash)` in Base64 notation `base64(sign(hash))` and use it to add `signature` field.

**-** `I` create a `payload` JSON made as follow:

    ```json

    {
      "sender_did": "<User did>",
      "pairwise_did": "<Pairwise Did to power up>",
      "timestamp": "<Timestamp>",
      "signature": "base64(sign(hash))",
    }

    ```

**-** `I` create a random AES-256 key `F`.

**-** `I` generate a random 96-bit nonce `N`.

**-** `I` encrypt the `payload` using the `F` AES-256 key.

  1. `I` remove all the white spaces and line ending characters.
  2. `I` encrypt the resulting string bytes using `F`, obtaining `ciphertext`. Note that the AES encryption method must be `AES-GCM`.
  3. `I` concatenate bytes of `ciphertext` and `N` and encode the resulting bytes using the Base64 encoding method, obtaining `proof`.

**-** `I` encrypt the AES-256 key.

  1. `I` Encrypt the `F` key bytes using the centralized system's RSA public key using PKCS1v15 mode.
  2. `I` Encode the resulting bytes using the Base64 encoding method, obtaining `proof_key`.

**-** `I` will create the transaction message as follows:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "commercio/MsgRequestDidPowerUp",
      "value": {
        "claimant": "<Address of the Did to fund>",
        "amount": [
          {
            "amount": "<Amount of coins to be sent>",
            "denom": "<Denom of the coin to send>"
          }   
        ],
        "proof": "<proof>",
        "id": "<uuid>",
        "proof_key": "<proof_key>"
      }
    }
    ```

**-** `I` will send a transaction of the `MsgRequestDidPowerUp` type.

    ```golang
    type MsgRequestDidPowerUp struct {
      Claimant sdk.AccAddress `json:"claimant"`
      Amount   sdk.Coins      `json:"amount"`
      Proof    string         `json:"proof"`
      ID       string         `json:"id"`
      ProofKey string         `json:"proof_key"`
    }
    ```

**-** `T` will be constantly listening for new transactions of the type described above. Once a new transaction is observed, it will decrypt the `proof_key` using its own private decryption key, obtaining`F` key.

**-** `T` will decrypt the `payload` using`aes_key` and it will get `I DDO` through the `I DID` contained within the transaction

**-** `T` will extract the public signature key of `I` from the obtained `I DDO` and it will verify the signature contained in the payload

**-** `T` will verify that  `I`  has sent a transferable amount of funds equal to or greater than that indicated in the transaction.

**-** If the transfer can be performed correctly, `T` will perform an on-chain transaction containing two messages:

    ```golang
    type MsgSend struct {
      FromAddress sdk.AccAddress `json:"from_address" yaml:"from_address"`
      ToAddress   sdk.AccAddress `json:"to_address" yaml:"to_address"`
      Amount      sdk.Coins      `json:"amount" yaml:"amount"`
    }

    type MsgChangePowerUpStatus struct {
      Recipient sdk.AccAddress `json:"recipient"`
      PowerUpID string         `json:"id"`
      Status    RequestStatus  `json:"status"`
      Signer    sdk.AccAddress `json:"signer"`
    }
    ```

**-** If the transfer cannot be performed correctly, `T` will perform an on-chain transaction with this message:

    ```golang
    type MsgChangePowerUpStatus struct {
      Recipient sdk.AccAddress `json:"recipient"`
      PowerUpID string         `json:"id"`
      Status    RequestStatus  `json:"status"`
      Signer    sdk.AccAddress `json:"signer"`
    }
    ```

**Claimant** is the public Did of who made the request (therefore the Signer of MsgRequirePowerupDid)

**Amount** is the quantity sent in the powerup request

**Proof** is the proof sent in the powerup request

**Signer** is the public `T DID`
