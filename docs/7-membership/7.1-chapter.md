## 7.1 Creating a network of Trusted Companies

Commercio.network mission is to bring the Blockchain technology to give companies the freedom to sign and exchange any document. To that in secure way we need create a network of Trusted Companies.

Our Blockchain have a reputation system nominally linked to the identity of a company or person that operates in our network. We have called this system ComemrcioMemership.  Thre are two types of memberships:

* **Free Memberships**: Anyone who join our network is a Green Member
* **Paid Membership**: Anyone who wishes to buy a Metal (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to gain premium services.

There is also incentive mechanism to invite other members, taht provides paying members bonuses in Token for acrediting other members.

The main reason for the CommercioMembership is that:

**Our ultimate goal is not just to share DOCUMENTS, but to create a network of trusted organizations**

### KYC and AML primer

When a commercio.network green member upgrades to a metal membership, it gets recognized into the system with two actions:

* KYC (Know your Customer procedure)
* AML (Anti Money Laundering procedure)

Customer due diligence means taking steps to identify the customers and checking they are who they say they are.

The Know Your Customer procedure along with the money laundering regulations is designed to protect all network partecipants, as well as providing a quick and easy solution to check identity in seconds.

Every time a commpany buys a membership, even a €25 bronze, There is an trusted organization that will verify the member identity and assess their suitability to join our trusted network. The purpose is to try to limit the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship with other members. 

There is no leagal obligation to do so, quite the contraty most companies never checks who they do business with. Commercio.network want to go the extra mile to ensure the best possible business environmnet among its members. 

#### We follow our self-imposed guidelines.

The objective of our KYC guidelines is to prevent our members to do businesses (financial and non-financial), intentionally or unintentionally, with criminal elements for money laundering activities. Our internal procedures also enable businesses to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. We are developing a credit system called CommercioSocre to help memeber companies to manage their risks when dealing with other memebers in a well judged manner.
