Our Blockchain have a reputation system nominally linked to the identity of a company or person that operates in our network. We have called this system ComemrcioMemership.  Thre are two types of memberships:

Free Memberships: Anyone who join our network is a Green Member
Paid Membership: Anyone who wishes to buy a Metal (bronze silver Gold) to gain Premium services.

There is also incentive mechanism to invite other members, taht provides paying members bonuses in Token for acrediting other members.

The main reason for the CommercioMembership is that:

**Our ultimate goal is not just to share DOCUMENTS, but to create a network of trusted organizations**

### KYC and AML primer

When a commercio.network green member upgrades to a metal membership, it gets recognized into the system with two actions:

* KYC (Know your Customer procedure)
* AML (Anti Money Laundering procedure)

#### The Know Your Customer Procedure

Customer due diligence means taking steps to identify the customers and checking they are who they say they are.
