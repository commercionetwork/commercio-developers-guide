# 5. CommercioSign

## 5.2 Simple Electronic Signature with a Self Signed Certificate in your DDO

### Use cases
Takes the given _data_, converts it to an alphabetically sorted JSON object and signs its content using the given _wallet_.

### Tools
The CommercioSDK, our own open source tool to format transactions to Commercio.network

### Functions and APIs
- SignHelper _signSorted_

###  Background
From Wikipedia:
> In cryptography and computer security, a self-signed certificate is a certificate that is not signed by a certificate authority (CA).

> Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) is a de facto file format for storing and sending cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data, based on a set of 1993 IETF standards defining "privacy-enhanced mail.

### Step by step sequence

#### Dart
1. Generate the wallet;
2. Finally, execute the SignHelper _signSorted_ to sign your data.

#### Kotlin
1. Generate the wallet;
2. Finally, execute the SignHelper _signSorted_ to sign your data. The resulting byte array represents the signature in ASN.1 DER format.

### Code Examples
Here's an example of the implemetation in all the available languages.

#### Dart
```dart
final wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic, networkInfo);

final data = {
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Smith",
  "email": "jsmith@test.com"
};

await SignHelper.signSorted(data, wallet);
```
#### Kotlin
```kotlin

val data ="\"name\": \"John\", \"surname\": \"Smith\",\"email\": \"jsmith@test.com\""

val wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic, networkInfo)

val signedData = SignHelper.signSorted(data, wallet)   
```
