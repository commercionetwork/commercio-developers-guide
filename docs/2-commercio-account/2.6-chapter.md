## Tools

The _qrscan_, a Flutter plugin to scanning.

## Functions and APIs

- Wallet _derive_.

## Step by step sequence

1. Execute Wallet the _derive_ function to generate the wallet;
2. Get your address;
3. Finally, generate the QR code.

## Code Examples

import 'package:qrscan/qrscan.dart' as scanner;

final wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic, networkInfo);
final address = wallet.bech32Address;

final qrCode = await scanner.generateBarCode(address);
```
