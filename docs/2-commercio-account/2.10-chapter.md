# Generate many addresses with a single mnemonic

You can generate a new wallet with your mnemonic by setting a different *derivation path* from the default one.

## Use cases

Create a dedicated address derived from the same seed to pairwise every single person we interact with.

## Tools

The _Sacco_ library, our own open source tool to sign and send transactions to any Cosmos SDK based blockchain, including Commercio.network.

## Functions and APIs

- Wallet _derive_.

## Background

From Wikipedia:
> A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and private keys and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies.

## Step by step sequence

1. Call the wallet _derive_ function setting the optional parameter **lastDerivationPathSegment**;
2. Finally, the result is a new address.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of the implementation in all the available languages.

### _Dart_

```dart
final mnemonicString = 'final random flame cinnamon grunt hazard easily mutual resist pond solution define knife female tongue crime atom jaguar alert library best forum lesson rigid';

final mnemonic = mnemonicString.split(' ');
final networkInfo = NetworkInfo(bech32Hrp: 'did:com:', lcdUrl: 'http://localhost:1317');

final wallet = Wallet.derive(
  mnemonic,
  networkInfo,
  lastDerivationPathSegment: '1',
);
```
