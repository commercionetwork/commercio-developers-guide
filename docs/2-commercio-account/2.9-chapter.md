# 2.9 Send a Token to another address

Let's perform another important task:

Send tokens to another account.

Like we explained in chapter 2.6 we learned that handling wallet addresses is not an easy task
Wallet address are pretty compex to write down or remember. If you just provide someone with even one digit or one letter wrong your money is lost forever
One way to get an address is scan a QR code.  BTW you should also check id the address is valid.

When you have the correct address we need to Send tokens to them:

Here's how to do it.

## Use cases

Send a token to another account

## Tools

The CommercioSDK, our own open source tool to format transactions to Commercio.network

## Functions and APIs

- TxHelper _createSignAndSendTx_.

## Step by step sequence

1. Generate the sender wallet;
2. Generate the recipient wallet;
3. Set up the gas;
4. Set up the amounts list;
5. Set up the messages list;
6. Finally, execute the TxHelper _createSignAndSendTx_ function to send the token.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of the implementation in all the available languages.

### _Dart_

```dart
final wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic, networkInfo);
final recipientWallet = Wallet.derive(recipientMnemonic, networkInfo);
final gas = '200000';
final amount = [const StdCoin(denom: 'ucommercio', amount: '20000')];
final amountFee = [const StdCoin(denom: 'ucommercio', amount: '10000')];
final msgs = [
  MsgSend(
    amount: amount,
    fromAddress: wallet.bech32Address,
    toAddress: recipientWallet.bech32Address,
  ),
];

final response = await TxHelper.createSignAndSendTx(
  msgs,
  wallet,
  fee: StdFee(
    gas: gas,
    amount: amountFee,
  ),
  mode: BroadcastingMode.SYNC,
);
```

### _Kotlin_

```kotlin
val wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic = mnemonic, networkInfo = networkInfo)
val recipientWallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic = recipientMnemonic, networkInfo = networkInfo)
val gas = "200000"
val amount = listOf(StdCoin( "ucommercio", "20000"))
val amountFee= listOf(StdCoin( "ucommercio", "10000"))
val msgs = listOf(
  MsgSend(
    amount = amount,
    fromAddress = wallet.bech32Address,
    toAddress = recipientWallet.bech32Address
  )
)

val response = TxHelper.createSignAndSendTx(
  msgs = msgs,
  wallet = wallet,
  fee = StdFee(
    gas = gas,
    amount = amountFee
  )
)
```

### _C#_

```csharp
var senderWallet = commercio.sacco.lib.Wallet.derive(senderMnemonic, networkInfo);

var recipientWallet = commercio.sacco.lib.Wallet.derive(recipientMnemonic, networkInfo);

var gas = "200000";
List<commercio.sacco.lib.StdCoin> amount = new List<commercio.sacco.lib.StdCoin>();
amount.Add(new commercio.sacco.lib.StdCoin(denom: "ucommercio", amount: "10"));

var msgs = new List<commercio.sacco.lib.StdMsg>();
msgs.Add(new commercio.sacco.lib.MsgSend(
   amount: amount,
   fromAddress: senderWallet.bech32Address,
   toAddress: recipientWallet.bech32Address
 ));

var res = commercio.sdk.TxHelper.createSignAndSendTx(
 msgs,
 senderWallet,
 fee: new commercio.sacco.lib.StdFee(
   gas: gas,
   amount: amount
 ));
```
