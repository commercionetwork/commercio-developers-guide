## 2.2 Generate an HD Wallet

### Use cases
You **must** create a wallet before doing anything with the tools offered by Commercio.network SDK.

In our case the wallet will be used to sign, with the keys contained in it, the transactions that will then be sended to the Commercio.network blockchain.

### Tools
The _Sacco_ library, our own open source tool to sign and send transactions to any Cosmos SDK based blockchain, including Commercio.network.

The Bitcoin _BIP39_ Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.

### Functions and APIs
- Wallet _derive_

###  Background
From Wikipedia:
> A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and private keys and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies.

### Step by step sequence
- Generate mnemonic using bip39 and save the value;
- Set up the network;
- Call the wallet _derive_ function;
- Finally, the result is a new wallet.

### Code Examples
Here's an example of the implementation in all the available languages.

#### Dart
```dart
final mnemonicString = "final random flame cinnamon grunt hazard easily mutual resist pond solution define knife female tongue crime atom jaguar alert library best forum lesson rigid";

final mnemonic = mnemonicString.split(" ");
final networkInfo = NetworkInfo(bech32Hrp: "did:com", lcdUrl: "http://localhost:1317");

final wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic, networkInfo);
```

#### Kotlin
```kotlin
 val mnemonic = listOf("final random flame cinnamon grunt hazard easily mutual resist pond solution define knife female tongue crime atom jaguar alert library best forum lesson rigid")
 val networkInfo = NetworkInfo(bech32Hrp = "did:com:", lcdUrl = "http://localhost:1317")
  
 val wallet = Wallet.derive(mnemonic = mnemonic, networkInfo = networkInfo)
```
